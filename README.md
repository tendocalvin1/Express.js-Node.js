# Express.js-Node.js


# 👨‍💻 Tendo Calvin — Software Engineer (Node.js | Backend Systems | APIs)

I build **secure, scalable, production-ready backend systems** using **Node.js**, modern databases, and cloud deployment practices.

This repository documents **real engineering work**: APIs, authentication systems, database integrations, testing, and deployment pipelines — the exact skills used in professional backend teams.

---

## 🧠 Core Engineering Competencies

* Designing and building **RESTful APIs** with Express & NestJS
* Implementing **authentication & authorization** (JWT, OAuth, sessions, bcrypt)
* Working with **SQL & NoSQL databases** (Mysql, MongoDB, Redis)
* Writing **tested, maintainable code** (Jest, Supertest)
* Applying **security best practices** (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, validation)
* Managing **environment configs** and production deployments
* Dockerizing applications and setting up **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
* Deploying to cloud platforms (Render, Railway, Vercel)
